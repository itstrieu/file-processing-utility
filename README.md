### File Processing Utility
A Python tool designed to handle and preprocess data files efficiently for machine learning workflows.

#### **Learning Objectives**
- **File Handling**: Reading, writing, and validating multiple file formats such as CSV, JSON, and TXT.
- **Data Validation**: Implementing checks for missing values, data type consistency, and schema compliance.
- **Transformation and Reporting**: Automating data transformations (e.g., normalization, filtering) and generating summary reports.

#### **Skills Being Practiced**
- **Python File I/O**: Working with different file formats and file operations.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing robust exception handling for file-related errors.
- **Modular Programming**: Writing clean, reusable, and testable code.

#### **Project Significance**
This project mimics real-world tasks like data preprocessing and validation, which are crucial for release engineering and machine learning pipelines.
